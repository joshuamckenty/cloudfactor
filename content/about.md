# Cloud Factor Applications

The notion of the [12factor application](http://12factor.net), while revolutionary,
has unfortunately led an entire generation of software developers off the path and
deep into the woods.

It is predicated on the concept of a "runtime environment", or platform, where such
cloud native applications can be hosted. Yet all discussion of the qualifications
of such a platform was left out of the manifesto.

We aim to fix this.
