 There is a compromise on the one repo = one app, which is why we support Procfile within Cloud Foundry: that of the asynchronous worker. Logically, the worker (which consumes the queue) and the dispatch (which publishes to the queue) often *are* the same application, although they run in separate processes and perhaps separate containers. And theyâ€™re scaled differently.
